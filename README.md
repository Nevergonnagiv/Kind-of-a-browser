So,
I'm trying to get a really good web,
and later app, developer.
I tried something little 
'challenging' if i spelled that right.
I tried to make a browser in
a most complicated way that exists.
Still, this website is nowhere done,
and i don't think it will be done soon.
If you find mistakes, bugs or want to
give me a feedback, opinion about my website,
then, you can contact me on this email:
